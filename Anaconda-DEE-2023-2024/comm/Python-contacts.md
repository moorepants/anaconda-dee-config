## Some first observations

Below are some observations further to the inquiry;

  1 no objections were noticed, to gradually move the focus away from the use of 
    Jupyter Notebook towards the use of JupyterLab, as proposed

  2 no objections were received as to the installation of Visual Studio Code; 
  moreover, a request has been issued to additionally install PyCharm (the 
  latter however, supports only Python, not the notebooks)

  3 the use of `numba` may give rise to the need for a third additional environment
    as its installation is more involved than that of the other environments. 
    Although, according to the document of the latest version of numba 
    [see the Numba docs](https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/installing.html): 

    > Numba supports Intel and AMD x86, POWER8/9, and ARM CPUs (including Apple M1), 
    NVIDIA GPUs, Python 3.7-3.10, as well as Windows/macOS/Linux. Precompiled Numba 
    binaries for most systems are available as conda packages and pip-installable wheels
