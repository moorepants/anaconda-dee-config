===========

- Removed the pytorch channel for building the pytorch environment to support
  linux and mac installers. The pytorch environment is now built solely from
  the Conda Forge packages. The cpuonly and torchaudio packages were removed
  due to not being available from Conda Forge.
- Updated packages:

  - [base] repa::0.10.1c -> conda-forge::0.10.2
  - [base] statsmodels 0.14.4 -> statsmodels to 0.14.5 (to be compatible with
    SciPy 1.16.0)
  - [pytorch] numpy 2.3.0 -> numpy 2.3.1
  - [pytorch] pytorch 2.5.1 -> pytorch 2.7.1
  - [pytorch] rdkit 2025.03.3 -> rdkit 2025.03.4
